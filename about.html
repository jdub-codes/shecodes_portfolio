            <h3>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged.

			<h2>About me.</h2>
			<h3>Storytelling runs in my blood. I was six years old when my grandfather asked me, "If I wrote a book for you, what would it be about?"
            <h3>I replied, "Write me a book about a fairy princess." After my grandfather passed, and I was going through his things, and I found the book he wrote for me all those years ago.</h3> 
            <h3>And the rest is history. We all have a story to tell and this portfolio is the story of my journey through the SheCodes course.</h3>
            <h3>Learning to code is like writing a novel. There are highs and lows, and you pour your heart and soul into it. There are somes pages missing and others already written.</h3>
            <h3>Like with all good fairly tales, I'm beginning to see my happily ever after. Who knows what my next story will be? I have a feeling it will involve coding.</h3>
