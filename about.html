			<h2>About me.</h2>
			<h3>Storytelling runs in my blood. I was six years old when my grandfather asked me, "If I wrote a book for you, what would it be about?" I replied, "Write me a book about a fairy princess." After my grandfather passed, and I was going through his things, and I found the book he wrote for me all those years ago. And the rest is history. We all have a story to tell and this portfolio is the story of my journey through the SheCodes course. Learning to code this site has been like writing a novel. There are somes pages already written and others waiting for words. It's a work in progress. Like in all good fairly tales, I'm beginning to see my happily ever after. And who knows what my next chapter will be? I have a feeling it will involve coding.
